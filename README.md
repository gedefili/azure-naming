This project provides a secure, auditable, and standards-compliant Azure naming service. It uses Azure Functions, Table Storage, and Entra ID for identity and access control.

## 🧠 Features

* ✅ Slug-based, consistent naming generation
* 🔐 Role-based access control (Entra ID)
* 🧾 Audit logs and user history
* ♻️ Release + recycle name logic
* 🔁 Slug sync from Azure naming standards
* 🧩 Extensible provider model for naming rules and slug resolution

---

## 📄 Endpoints

* `POST /api/claim` — generate and reserve a name
* `GET  /api/slug?resource_type=` — resolve the slug for a resource type
* `POST /api/release` — release an existing name
* `GET  /api/audit?name=` — audit a single name
* `GET  /api/audit_bulk?...` — audit a user/project/time
* `POST /api/slug_sync` — manually refresh slugs (default provider updates Table Storage)
* `GET  /api/docs` — interactive Swagger UI for every endpoint
* `GET  /api/openapi.json` — machine-readable OpenAPI 3.0 document

Each endpoint requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header issued by Entra ID.

### 🔑 App Roles

Assign one of the custom app roles to callers in Entra ID:

| Role | Permissions |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Sanmar Naming Reader** | View OpenAPI docs and query audits for your own activity. |
| **Sanmar Naming Contributor** | Generate/release names and query audits. |
| **Sanmar Naming Admin** | Everything above plus slug sync and cross-user audits. |

Tokens are validated server-side; no function keys are required.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Standard

The current production standard is a two-repository flow:

* Provision infrastructure from `environs-iac` at `sanmar/applications/internal/azure-naming/service`
* Let Terraform create the Function App, storage resources, monitoring resources, and the Entra API app registration
* Publish this application repository to the provisioned Function App through the GitHub Actions deploy workflow

See [docs/05-operations/deployment.md](docs/05-operations/deployment.md) for the current sequence and handoff points.

## ✅ Branch Protection

Require the `Integration tests` workflow before merging to `main`:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Branches**, edit (or create) the rule for `main`.
2. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
3. Select **Integration tests** (workflow file: `.github/workflows/integration.yml`).
4. Save the rule so that every merge validates the end-to-end suite.

## 🔌 Extensibility Overview

Both naming rules and slug resolution use a **pluggable provider architecture**. The default providers load rules from in-repo configuration and slugs from Azure Table Storage (populated by the scheduled sync). You can override either pipeline without changing the HTTP routes:

| Extension Point | Default Provider | How to Override |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Naming rules    | Layered JSON definitions in `rules/*.json` loaded by `core.naming_rules` | Set `NAMING_RULE_PROVIDER` to a `module.callable` that returns an object with `get_rule(resource_type)` or call `core.naming_rules.set_rule_provider(...)` during startup. Override the rules directory with `NAMING_RULES_PATH=/path/to/dir` (legacy `NAMING_RULES_FILE` still supported). |
| Slugs           | `adapters.slug.TableSlugProvider` via `core.slug_service` | Set `SLUG_PROVIDER` to a `module.attr` that returns one or more providers implementing `get_slug(resource_type)` or call `core.slug_service.set_slug_providers([...])`. |

Providers are evaluated in order until one succeeds. This makes it straightforward to layer in custom data sources (for example, in-memory caches, REST lookups, or alternative storage) while keeping the rest of the system unchanged.

## 🔐 Bearer token (local testing)

Most endpoints require an Entra ID bearer token with one of the app roles (Reader, Contributor or Admin). For local testing you have several options:

- Azure CLI (quick):

```bash
az account get-access-token --resource api://<AZURE_CLIENT_ID> --query accessToken -o tsv
```

- Repository helper (prints token + claims):

```bash
python tools/get_access_token.py --show-claims --client-id "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID"
# Copy the token between the markers and export it for curl/Postman
export ACCESS_TOKEN="<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>"
```

Using the token with Postman / Newman / curl

- Postman: set environment variable `auth_token` to the raw token value (the included collection reads `Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}`).
- Newman (CLI): inject the token into the included environment file before running:

```bash
jq --arg token "$ACCESS_TOKEN" '.values |= map(if .key=="auth_token" then .value=$token else . end)' tests/postman_environment.json > /tmp/env.json
npx newman run tests/postman_collection.json -e /tmp/env.json --insecure
```

GitHub Actions

- `postman.yml` supports a `bearer_token` workflow input when you manually dispatch the workflow; the workflow is input-only and does not read repository secrets. For CI runs that need authenticated Postman requests, provide the token as the `bearer_token` input when dispatching the workflow. Avoid storing long-lived tokens in repository secrets—prefer short-lived test tokens or run tests locally with the token helper.

Local integration helper

Use the helper to run integration tests locally and optionally perform an authenticated smoke test.

```bash
# Run integration tests (requires .venv with dependencies installed and Azurite running)
python3 tools/run_integration_locally.py

# Run integration tests and authenticated smoke test with explicit token
python3 tools/run_integration_locally.py --token "$ACCESS_TOKEN" --function-url "http://localhost:7071"

# Or have the helper invoke the token helper (requires az login and client id)
python3 tools/run_integration_locally.py --client-id "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID"
```
