# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, please report it
privately so we can address it before disclosing publicly.

Preferred process:

1. Email security@your-domain.example (replace with the project maintainer's
   address) with details and reproduction steps.
2. If email isn't possible, open a private report via GitHub's vulnerability
   reporting flow.

Do not include exploit code in public issue trackers. We'll acknowledge
receipt and provide a timeline for a fix.
